      <h3 style="color:white;">Experience and Schooling</h3>
      <p id="XP">Originally a Bright Flight student going to Mizzou and majoring in Business and Marketing, I moved into the pharmaceutical world working for a long-term-care pharmacy. After working in LTC from 2013-2018, I moved on to the world of hospital pharmacy. In late 2019, I was contacted with an offer for a new long-term-care pharmacy that was opening and I moved on again. Recently a passion for computer science has ignited within me and I have started going back to school with a different goal in mind. The experience I do have in the computer field is rapidly growing with IT at the pharmacy, HTML coding, and C# development. I continue to strive and add to my knowledge base each and every day.</p>

      <h3 style="color:white;">Goals and Aspirations</h3>
      <p id="XP">The number one goal is always to provide my family and I with the best life I can manage. Currently, that is with a career path change. I would like to get all of the experience I can in programming and apply that knowledge in the right work place. Eventually I would like to develop a suite of medical apps that improve patient/doctor interaction and help people get the treatment they need, wherever they need it.</p>
